# Fire Ball
This is the API for the Fire Ball platform. The Fireball platform is an open source learning environment where learners are free to access classes free of charge at zero cost.

We believe that knowledge is free and should be accessible to anyone irrespective of how much they have. This platform not only aids in making learning free, we also hope to make learning as simple as possible so that users can grasp very complicated concepts easily.

### setup
* clone the repostiory
* create a new branch and checkout to that new branch
* create a **local_env.yml** in the **config** directory to store your enviromental    variables
* the **local_env.yml** file should have the following:
    DB_NAME: database name
    DB_PASSWORD: database password
    AMAZON_API_KEY:amazone s3 api key
    AMAZON_SECRET_KEY: amazone s3 secret key
    BUCKET_NAME: amazone s3 bucket name
