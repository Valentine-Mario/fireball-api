# Fire Ball
This is the API for the Fire Ball platform. The Fireball platform is an open source learning environment where learners are free to access classes free of charge at zero cost.

We believe that knowledge is free and should be accessible to anyone irrespective of how much they have. This platform not only aids in making learning free, we also hope to make learning as simple as possible so that users can grasp very complicated concepts easily.

## Contribution
Anyone can contribute to the development of the platform via:
* Pushing code for updates or bug fix to their repository
* Designing a logo and branding
* Vetting content for approval
* Uploading free content for users which should meet the required guideline
